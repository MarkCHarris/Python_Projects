###Wear_Time.py
This program is meant for use with the .csv output of the Actigraph GT3X accelerometer, which quantitatively records physical activity counts every 10 seconds. Before this data can be converted into metabolic equivalents, non-wear time must be identified and filtered out at the scientist's discretion. This Python code allows the scientist to identify sequences of consecutive 0 counts in the "Vector Magnitude" variable (here renamed as "vm") of the data. For example, if the subject removed the Actigraph from 11am-1pm, there would be a string of 720 consecutive 0's (one every 10 seconds for 2 hours). If the scientist defines "non-wear" as one hour of 0 activity, this macro would identify all strings of 360 consecutive 0's. The output for this macro is a .csv file with one variable named "Wear" which codes 0 for non-wear and 1 for wear. The scientist can then combine this file with the original to filter the data as desired.
